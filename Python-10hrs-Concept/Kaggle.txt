What is CareerCon?
Kaggle CareerCon is a totally free, 
totally digital three-day event that's all about helping 
new data scientists land their first data science jobs. 
This year the event will be held from April 16 - 18th. 
In addition to the seminars and panel discussions, 
we'll be holding live coding workshops covering practical, 
professional data science skills. 
You'll also gain access to the Event Slack Channel 
where we'll hold a digital career fair for networking and 
live AMAs with recruiters.
